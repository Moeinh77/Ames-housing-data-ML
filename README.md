Models LinearRegression, RidgeCV, LassoCV, ElasticNetCV have been compared for predicitng price of houses in in Ames housing data set.

For each model I have trained it then predicted the prices ,once using all the features (and features I engineered) in traing data and once with K features selected by SelectKBest of scikit learn libray from the data.I have tried to find the best number for k with testing different values of k in the code
